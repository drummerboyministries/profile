# Profile

A basic profile with a picture, background image, and a bio.

The intent is that this app contain the information that is intrinsic to a user, and any other information, like group affiliations or relational data, should be in a separate app. Specifically, particularly relevent church-y affiliations can be found in the roster app of Drummer Boy Ministries.

Furthermore, there should be permissions in this app. The goal is NOT to depend on security by obscurity, but to have a basic (that is: functional but not necessarily user-friendly) permissions structure for the profile information contained here. It should remain functional for external apps like the roster app.

This app is meant to have good logging and recordkeeping. That is: the goal is to have any information that it is exposed to be delivered to SOMEONE, somewhere, eventually, in an actionable format.
